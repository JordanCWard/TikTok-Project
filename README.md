# TikTok-Project



- showing the structuring and cleaning you did
- matplotlib/seaborn visualizations you plotted to help us understand the data
  - graph comparing claim counts to opinion counts
  - boxplots of the most important variables (like “video duration,” “video like count,” “video comment count,” and “video view count”) to check for outliers
  - breakdown of “author ban status” counts.
    
- all EDA to include Tableau visualizations: Tableau dashboard
  - showing a simple claims versus opinions count
  - stacked bar charts of claims versus opinions for variables like video view counts, video like counts, video share counts, and video download counts
  - easy to understand to someone who isn’t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director is a person with visual impairments
